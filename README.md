Segmentation masks for apoptotic cells are saved in Z:/Michael_Glombitza/Masterarbeit/Masterarbeit/figures/figure2/apoptosis/segmentation/dead_cells/ilastik/, 
including the following samples: 01, 02, 04, 06, 07, 08, 09, and 11. The filenames follow the format SampleXY-red_Simple Segmentation.tiff, where XY represents the sample number.

The area of the apoptotic cells are calculated with the uploaded FIJI macro and saved in the excel file "C:\\Users\\micha\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\segmentation_pescoids.xlsx" with the sheetName: "dead_cells"
